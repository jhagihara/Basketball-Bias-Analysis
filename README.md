# Basketball-Bias-Analysis
This is a project for Philosophy: Technology and Human Values in which I attempt to uncover biases in sports data, specifically when using machine learning models to predict draft round picks in the NBA. It is important that these biases are known and addressed since this can affect the integrity of the predictions as well as the athletes' wellbeing/careers.

I will be doing some exploratory data analysis to initally discover any biases or interesting relationships between the data features. I will then be using a random forest classifier to show which features are the most heavily relied on when making a prediciton for the players' draft pick round.

The data I used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data/data
